# ContentCharts v1.1
A program that gathers various content/media platform's chart data and employs its statistics onto an easy-to-understand Streamlit webpage. 
You can use the program to see what content/media is currently popular on a platform.
This is the first version, and is a work-in-progress, it will be further updated as more, major changes are made.
This was made to further familiarize myself with the Python language and the Streamlit service.
